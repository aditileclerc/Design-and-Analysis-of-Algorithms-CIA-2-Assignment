Genetic Algorithms and Optimization Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various optimization techniques using Python, including Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). These algorithms solve problems like function optimization and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The code demonstrates techniques like mutation, reproduction, and fitness evaluation.



Features

Function Optimization using Genetic Algorithms:

1.Optimizes a mathematical function using genetic principles like mutation, crossover, and fitness evaluation.
2.Includes custom decoding functions to map binary representations to the problem's solution space.

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Genetic Algorithms:

1.Solves TSP using genetic algorithms with customized mutation and crossover operations.
2.Fitness evaluation is based on the total distance of the path.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):

1.Implements ACO to solve TSP using pheromone-based optimization.
2.Parameters for pheromone decay, alpha, and beta can be tuned.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):

1.Solves function optimization using swarm intelligence.
2.Includes custom PSO implementations and PySwarms library usage.
